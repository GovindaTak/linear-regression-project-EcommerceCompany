# linear-regression-project-EcommerceCompany
 This project covers a detailed implementation of Linear Regression, including model training, evaluation, and error metrics. It focuses on predicting outcomes based on input features using Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn. The notebook explores the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model tuning.

# Linear Regression Project

This repository contains a solution to a linear regression project, where the objective is to predict numerical outcomes based on input variables. The project involves the following steps:

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and feature scaling.
- **Model Training**: Implemented and trained a Linear Regression model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized data distributions and residuals.
  
## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
